# Sum Three
## Description
Given an array nums of n integers,
are there elements a, b, c in nums such that a + b + c = 0?

Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

## Note:
The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

## Example:
Given array nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4],

A solution set is:
[
  [-1, 0, 1],
  [-1, -1, 2]
]
